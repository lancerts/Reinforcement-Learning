# Reinforcement-Learning


This repository contains a collection of reinforcement learning algorithms.

The repository currently contains the following algorithms:
* **Q-Table** - An implementation of Q-learning using tables to solve a stochastic environment problem.
* **Q-Network** - A neural network implementation of Q-Learning to solve the same environment as in Q-Table.
* **Policy-Network** - An implementation of a neural network policy-gradient agent that solves full RL problems with states and delayed rewards, and two opposite actions (ie. CartPole or Pong).
